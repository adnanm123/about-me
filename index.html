<h1 class="header2">About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Adnan Mohamud, and I go by the pronouns he/him. I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Informatics with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. As part of my major requirements, I completed a few coding classes, although it has been some time since I last actively used those skills. Before joining this program, I worked as a UX designer at a small company based in France called Ringover, where I dedicated approximately a year and a half. This experience allowed me to gain valuable insights into the world of user experience design and strengthen my ability to create intuitive and seamless digital experiences. Now, I'm excited to embark on a personal project where I can further expand my skillset and pursue my passion for software development. My goal is to become a well-rounded professional in the field and contribute to impactful projects. I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and collaborating on exciting endeavors.</p>
